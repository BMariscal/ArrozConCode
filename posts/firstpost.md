Your skills can be developed and can improve over time by studying, reading, and practicing, lots of practice. The <i>trick</i> to succeeding in this field as an entry-level self-taught developer is to not give up. Even if it's frustrating, even if it takes you days/weeks/months to grasp a concept, do not give up.

The first time I tried to Dockerize and deploy a project to AWS I did it without a tutorial. I read the Docker and AWS documentations and tried to see if I could make it work. It took me a couple of weeks to make it work but I learned a ton. I believe that battle wounds not only make you psychologically stronger but make you better at your job. Get your hands a little dirty, try things out without crutches, break things and fix them. Software development's high level of abstraction reduces errors and makes it easier for you to develop apps but these abstractions also hide a lot of context from you ... context you should really know in order to debug any issues that may arise.

As a software developer, you need to be OK with the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns (yes, I'm quoting <b>[Rumsfeld here](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article/60/3/712/453685_)</b>). There are many things you don't know right now but it's OK because you can learn. At any given time there are going to be a lot of concepts/technologies you don't know YET, but luckily, search engines, your colleagues, StackOverflow, and engineering books and blogs are there to help you learn and grow your skills.

If you currently don't understand a concept or don't know how to implement something, use a growth mindset frame of mind to maintain optimism and resilience: "I may not know what that is/how to do that right now but I can learn ... give me a few days/weeks/months and I can do it. I will not give up. I can do it."

<p>
You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do.

As a junior engineer, it is important to surround yourself with people who believe in your skills. Meritocracy is a myth. "Pulling oneself up by the bootstraps" is impossible. It takes a village to lift you up. You will do 99% of the work to reach your goals but that 1%
will be your support system, the people who believe in you.

Surround yourself with positive people who will give you critical feedback when needed but who also believe in your abilities to learn anything you set your mind to. As a woman in tech, I'm afraid of uncertainty, I'm unsure of my abilities and I'm not comfortable with my knowledge gaps but I have several male mentors who have encouraged me to do more throughout my career and who have believed in my abilities to learn, to code and to succeed. Pretend you are a confident man for a day, take a risk and <b><u>[just do the thing you think you cannot do](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/05/the-confidence-gap/359815/)</u></b>. Apply for the job you don't think you're qualified for because why not? what do you have to lose anyway? You're a confident dude, just brush it off, move on and apply to the next job.

I recently ran across this strategy to get new concepts to click:

<a class="links" href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/adept-method/" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/p7r0iJh.png" alt="method" style="max-width:100%; height:15rem;"></a>

<cite>
<a class="links" href="https://betterexplained.com/articles/adept-method/" target="_blank">
Make explanations ADEPT:</a> </cite> Use an Analogy, Diagram, Example, Plain-English description, and then a Technical description
</i>

</br>
</br>

Don't rely on tutorials to draw things out for you, draw them out yourself. Learn how you learn (what's your learning style? what makes concepts click for you?) and do the extra work tailored to your needs to make those new abstract concepts click.

You are not perfect and you do not have to be perfect to succeed in this field. It's OK to not know <b>x/y/z</b> right now but you will learn it. You can learn it.

Stay curious. There's so much to learn, so little time and so many ways to waste time (Netflix, why you do this?! Do I really need to watch <i> New Girl</i> again? <b> YES </b> üòâ).
