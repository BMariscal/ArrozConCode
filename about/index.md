Hello! I'm Briceida (Bree-say-dah) but I often go by Bri/Brie. I'm a software developer in San Francisco.
You can read more about my software engineering journey [here](https://medium.com/engineers-optimizely/from-security-guard-to-backend-engineer-how-the-i-own-it-scholarship-changed-my-life-ebf1d370ffc3).


In this blog, I plan to cover concepts, tips and tools I've learned/am learning to increase my understanding of backend web development to hopefully help people who are new to tech and interested in backend-web-development.

What does `Arroz Con Code` mean? 

* *Literal translation:* Rice With Code.
* *What?*  In Latin America, there are several rice-based dishes like:

  * Arroz con leche (Rice Pudding)
  * Arroz con pollo (Chicken with rice)
  * Arroz con coco (Coconut rice)
  * Arroz con gandules (Rice with pigeon peas)

Growing up, my mom always cooked arroz con pollo on our birthdays and I remember eating arroz con coco with fried fish and candied bananas (`Platanos en Tentacion`) every time I went to my grandmother's home. Arroz con gandules was always and will always be my favorite dish. Rice-based dishes are a big part of Latin American/Caribbean cusine.  

  Arroz Con Code is an amalgamation of two of the best things in life, food and coding.
