Hello! I'm Briceida (Bree-say-dah) but I often go by Bri/Brie. I'm a software developer in San Francisco.
You can read more about my software engineering journey [here](https://medium.com/engineers-optimizely/from-security-guard-to-backend-engineer-how-the-i-own-it-scholarship-changed-my-life-ebf1d370ffc3).


In this blog, I plan to cover concepts, tips and tools I've learned/am learning to increase my understanding of backend web development to hopefully help people who are new to tech and interested in backend-web-development.
