What does <span> Arroz Con Code</span> mean?
<br>
Literal translation: <i>Rice With Code.</i>
</div>
<br>
<div>
Back in Panama when I was a tiny Briceida, my mom always cooked arroz con pollo on birthdays and I remember eating arroz con coco with fried fish and candied bananas (<i>Platanos en Tentacion</i>) every time I went to my grandmother's home. Arroz con gandules was always and will always be my favorite dish. Rice-based dishes are a big staple in Latin American/Caribbean cusine.

<div>
Arroz Con Code is an amalgamation of two of the best things in life (imo), food and coding!
