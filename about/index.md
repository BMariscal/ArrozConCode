Hello! I'm Briceida <span>(Bree-say-dah)</span> but I often go by Bri/Brie. I'm a software developer in San Francisco.
I was born in Panama and moved to the U.S when I was 11 years old. I grew up in the U.S as an undocumented immigrant and became a DACA recipient in 2012. <div>
You can read more about my software engineering journey <u><a href="https://medium.com/engineers-optimizely/from-security-guard-to-backend-engineer-how-the-i-own-it-scholarship-changed-my-life-ebf1d370ffc3" target="_blank">here</a></u>.

In this blog, I plan to cover concepts, tips and tools I've learned/am learning to increase my understanding of backend web development to hopefully help people who are self-taught/new to tech and interested in backend web development.

I still love Anthropology. Much like Philosophy, Anthropology doesn't pay well/at all, but it's still awesome. Anthropology makes you think about the world around you, the world that exists beyond what you can see. This field pushes us to self-reflect and think about how nature and nurture shape who we are as a species; how cultural constructs shape our laws, every day lives and behaviors.

<li>
As a multiracial and socially anxious person who has always felt like an outsider, Anthropology was/is a way for me to understand society and the world around me. I'm still interested in <i>Biopolitics</i> and how nature/culture impact how we interact and shape our world.

<summary>What does <span> Arroz Con Code</span> mean?</summary>
<br>
Literal translation: <i>Rice With Code.</i>
<br>
Back in Panama when I was a tiny Briceida, my mom always cooked arroz con pollo on birthdays and I remember eating arroz con coco with fried fish and candied bananas (<i>Platanos en Tentacion</i>) every time I went to my grandmother's home. Arroz con gandules was always and will always be my favorite dish. Rice-based dishes are a big staple in Latin American/Caribbean cusine.
<br>
<div>
Arroz Con Code is an amalgamation of two of the best things in life (imo), food and coding!
